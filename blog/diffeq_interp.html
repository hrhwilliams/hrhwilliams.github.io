<p>
I think differential equations are interesting. Many physical processes are modeled by
them, popping up all over physics and chemistry. They provide a way to define a function in a more natural way in some contexts, such as talking about how drag works to slow you down the faster you are going, or talking about how a population might double year after year. Both of these implicitly use the language of differential equations to show some relationship.
<span class="math display">\[
    x''(t) = -\gamma x'(t),
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x''(t)\)</span> is the acceleration by drag on something moving at velocity <span class="math inline">\(x'(t)\)</span>.

<span class="math display">\[
    y'(t) = \alpha y(t),
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span> is the population of some species and <span class="math inline">\(y'(t)\)</span> is its rate of growth.
</p>

<p>
My interest in differential equations lead me to explore methods of computationally solving them, known as numerical integration. As I studied more about this topic I also became interested in writing a program that would allow a user to input an equation in the form shown above, and the program would perform algebra on the input if necessary and then return a solution. I hope to talk about everything I learned over the course of a few articles, this one mainly being an introduction to how differential equations can be solved by numerical integration, and an introduction to how simple mathematical expressions can be parsed and interpreted.
</p>
<h1>Ordinary Differential Equations</h1>
<p>
Specifically, I’ll only talk about ordinary differential equations now, which only involve a single independent variable. At a high level, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a relation between the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th derivative of some function <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of the independent variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and every derivative of <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span> up to but not including <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <i>i.e.</i>
</p>
<span class="math display">\[
    y^{\left(n\right)} = f\left(x, y'(x), y''(x), \dots, y^{\left(n-1\right)}(x)\right).
\]</span>
<p>
For example, a first order ODE is a function of just <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span>. Finding a solution to an ordinary differential equation entails finding an expression of <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span> that satisfies the relation when differentiated. Just like how taking the antiderivative of a function yields a constant term to account for losing any constants from differentiation, the solution to an ODE also yields a constant term. The full solution to an ODE is an entire family of functions. For example, the solution to the first order ODE
</p>
<span class="math display">\[
    \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} = -2xy
\]</span>
<p>
can be found by multiplying both sides by <span class="math inline">\(\text{d}x\)</span>, dividing by <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and integrating:
</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&\int \frac{\text{d}y}{y} = -\int 2x\,\text{d}x \\
&\ln y = - x^{2} + c \\
&y = e^{-x^{2} + c} \\
&y = ce^{-x^{2}},
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>
The constant term <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> means that technically any function of the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = ce^{-x^{2}}\)</span> is a solution to the ODE. To verify that this is a solution to the ODE, plug in <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> to the original equation:
</p>
<span class="math display">\[
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}\left(ce^{-x^{2}}\right) =
-2x\left(ce^{-x^{2}}\right).
\]</span>
<p>
Finding a particular solution to an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th order ODE involves finding one of this family of functions that satisfies an initial condition given by <span class="math inline">\((x_{0}, y_{0}, y'_{0},\dots, y^{\left(n-1\right)}_{0})\)</span>. Thinking of just a first order ODE for now, this implies finding the curve that passes through the point on the plane <span class="math inline">\((x_{0}, y_{0})\)</span>.
</p>
<h2>Euler’s Method</h2>
<p>
Finding the exact set of solutions to an ODE as we just did is complicated; there is no method that works for every ODE of any order. If we want to find an algorithm to numerically integrate any ODE we desire, we will have to find some method that can at least approximate a solution. First, we make the observation that plugging in the point <span class="math inline">\((x_{0}, y_{0})\)</span> into the equation <span class="math inline">\(y'(x) = f(x, y(x))\)</span> gives the ‘slope’ at that point. The simplest way to approximate the curve <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span> from this information would be to draw a line from that point with the slope given by the function for some distance <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, find the slope at the new point, and then repeat this process for as long as we like.
</p>
<p>
This method of numerical integration was invented by Euler. It can be derived from the definition of the derivative of a function:
</p>
<span class="math display">\[
\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} \approx \frac{y(x + h) - y(x)}{h},
\]</span>
<p>
where <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a small distance that approaches zero, thus making the approximation more and more precise. Rearranging and substituting <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y(x))\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y'\)</span>,
</p>
<span class="math display">\[
y(x + h) \approx y(x) + hf(x, y(x)).
\]</span>
<p>
Thus we can find the value of <span class="math inline">\(y(x+h)\)</span> from an initial value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and by plugging in the initial <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to our differential equation. We can turn this into an inductive formula to find many various points <span class="math inline">\((x_{n}, y_{n})\)</span> as so:
</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&x_{n+1} = x_{n} + h \\
&y_{n+1} = y_{n} + hf(x_{n}, y_{n}).
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>
As a simple example, we will use this method to numerically integrate over the ODE <span class="math inline">\(y' = y\)</span>. Its exact solution is <span class="math inline">\(e^{x}\)</span>, which we can compare to the values given by Euler’s method. Starting from the initial conditions <span class="math inline">\((x_{0}, y_{0}) = (0, 1)\)</span>, and using a step size of 0.5 we obtain a plot of one solution.
</p>
<img src="/blog/images/eulers_method.png" alt="Example of using Euler's method to solve y' = y">
<p>
We can see that the numerical solution rapidly diverges from the exact solution. This can be remedied by using a smaller step size, or methods that are smarter about how they sample the slope of the equation. For now, we increase the step size to 0.1 to obtain a slightly more accurate solution.
</p>
<img src="/blog/images/eulers_method2.png" alt="Example of using Euler's method to solve y' = y with smaller step size">
<p>
Implementing this in practice, we would use even smaller step sizes to minimize the error further. Computers are much better at iterating over values than they are at applying one of many methods to an equation to find a set of solutions. In Python, we create a function for finding the next value <span class="math inline">\((x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(x_{n}, y_{n}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and the step size <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def eulers_method(f, x_n, y_n, step_size):
    return x_n, y_n + step_size * f(x_n, y_n)</code></pre>
<p>
Then we create an iterative <code>solve</code> function that takes an ODE, initial conditions, and a final value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to evaluate up to, and then returns arrays of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> points.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def solve(f, x_initial, y_initial, x_final):
    step_size = 0.01
    x, y = [x_initial], [y_initial]
    x_n, y_n = x_initial, y_initial

    while x_n &lt;= x_final:
        x_n, y_n = eulers_method(f, x_n, y_n, step_size)
        x.append(x_n)
        y.append(y_n)
    return x, y</code></pre>
<p>
For now we can keep <code>step_size</code> constant. Taking these two arrays, we can now easily use Pyplot to display the solution:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def f(x, y):
    return -2 * x * y

x, y = solve(f, x_initial=-2.5, y_initial=0.01, x_final=2.5)

plt.plot(x, y, c='black')
plt.grid(color='gray', linestyle=':', linewidth=1)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<img src="/blog/images/diffeq_interp_solution.png" alt="Solution to the differential equation y'=-2xy">
<p>
And this works for now, but it requires the user to define a function and run it within Python. It even requires the user to format the equation in a specific way, with the derivative appearing on its own on the left, and everything else on the right. The ODE <span class="math inline">\(y' = x + y\)</span> is just as valid written as <span class="math inline">\(y' - x = y\)</span>. To fix both of these problems, the next step is to make a way to input functions like these as strings, and to allow the computer to rearrange the functions it’s given in any way it sees fit.
</p>

<h1>Inputting and Interpreting Equations</h1>
<p>
Believe it or not, the solving of the differential equations in
this way was the easy part, at least programming-wise. As possibly
complicated the math concept is, at the end of the day, it’s just
a bunch of arithmetic that gives us what we want, a series of
points from an initial point that approximate the solution to a
certain differential equation. The hard part is what I wanted to
do next, write an interpreter that would let a user just type in a
few initial conditions and an equation, and have the interpreter
solve the equation and spit out a graph.

Overall, what this entails is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Transforming a string of text into useful pieces.</li>

<li>Making sure those pieces follow a certain ‘structure’, or grammar.</li>

<li>Performing some algebraic transformations on the pieces if they aren’t
in a certain expected form. (<i>e.g.</i> transforming <span class="math inline">\(y' - y = x\)</span>
into <span class="math inline">\(y' = y + x\)</span> if the latter is easier to evaluate.)</li>

<li>Assembling a function from those pieces that can actually be
interpreted and used in something like the <code>eulers_method</code> method from before.</li>

<li>Doing the actual numerical integration and returning a result.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Step one is simple enough. We want to break up strings into tokens, which are in essence
the smallest pieces of the string we care about for the purpose of understanding it. These
tokens are things like numbers, letters as variables, symbols like plus, minus, equals, and
most importantly the apostrophe to denote derivatives. A string like <code>y' = -2 * x * y</code>
might look like, as an array of tokens, <code>[VAR, QUOTE, EQUALS, MINUS, NUM, STAR, VAR, STAR, VAR]</code>,
abbreivating variable as <code>VAR</code> and number as <code>NUM</code>.
</p>
<h2>Tokenizing</h2>
<p>
Now to implement something that does this transformation.
We’ll create a data class called <code>Token</code> to store a token symbol such as <code>VAR</code>, as well as
an optional value associated with the specific token, such as ‘y’, or for a <code>NUM</code> token, a value like
2.1828. Now we begin looking through an input string character by character. Some tokens we can identify in a 
single character, such as the symbols ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘=’, ‘'’. Others we’ll need to look ahead, like numbers or
multi-character symbols. To keep things simple, variables will be limited to single characters, so there is no need
to do look ahead for those.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Token:
    def __init__(self, token, value=None):
        self.token = token
        self.value = value


def tokenize(string):
    tokens = []
    i = 0
    while True:
        if i > len(string) - 1:
            break
        c = string[i]
        if whitespace(c):
            i += 1
        elif number(c):
            num, i = read_number(string, i)
            tokens.append(Token('NUM', num))
        elif variable(c):
            tokens.append(Token('VAR', c))
            i += 1
        elif symbol(c):
            tokens.append(Token(c))
            i += 1
        elif c == ':':
            if i + 1 &lt; len(string) and string[i + 1] == '=':
                tokens.append(Token(':='))
                i += 2
            else:
                raise RuntimeError('Expected :=')
        else:
            raise RuntimeError('Invalid token')
    return tokens</pre></code>
<p>
The next step is much more involved. Now we want to create a grammar that relates these
tokens to the structure of an equation which we want to evaluate. There's a particular way
to represent grammars called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">Backus–Naur form</a> (BNF).
Backus–Naur form lets us specify the rules of how elements of our grammar should fit together, which we can
then use to check if some sentence is correct in our grammar or not. A simple example is a grammar that
accepts simple expressions such as <code>1 + 2 * 3</code>, <code>3 + 4 * 1 - 2</code>, and so on.
</p>
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>
A grammar checks if a sentence is correct by going through a stream of tokens and checking whether or not
they fit any rules in the grammar. For instance, if our grammar is extremely simple, just matching a number
on the left, a plus sign, and a number on the right, then any string such as <code>1 + 2</code> passes, but
the string <code>2 - 1</code> does not, because the symbol <code>-</code> does not appear in the grammar anywhere.
A grammar can be made more complex by introducing nonterminals. Nonterminals allow nesting of expressions in
our grammar, and thus can recognize a much wider set of strings than the first example grammar. For instance,
if we define an expression as
</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">expression := NUM ‘+’ expression | NUM</code></pre>
<p>
then <code>expression</code> is a nonterminal
in our language. Assuming that <code>NUM</code> just represents any number token, then <code>NUM</code> is a terminal.
The <code>‘|’</code> represents an <i>or</i> that lets the <code>expression</code> be either a number plus another expression, or just a number.
This grammar can recognize sentences such as <code>1</code>, <code>1 + 2</code>, <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6</code>, and longer,
because it can continuously nest to the right until it terminates at a <code>NUM</code> and then work backwards:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + 6))))
1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + expression)))
1 + (2 + (3 + expression))
1 + (2 + expression)
1 + expression
expression</code></pre>
<p>
We can code up a function that takes an array of tokens and returns <code>True</code> if the tokens match
the grammar, or <code>False</code> otherwise:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def expression(tokens):
    current_token = tokens[0]
    if current_token == 'NUM':
        if len(tokens) == 1:  # if there're no more tokens after matching 'NUM', then accept
            return True
        elif tokens[1] == '+' and len(tokens) &gt; 2: # if the tokens follow the pattern 'NUM' '+',
            return expression(tokens[2:])          # then test what comes after the '+'
        else:
            return False  # otherwise the tokens don't match, so return false.
    return False</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; expression(['NUM'])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; expression(['NUM', '+', 'NUM'])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; expression(['NUM', '+', 'NUM', '+', 'NUM', '+', 'NUM'])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; expression(['NUM', '+'])
False</code></pre>
<p>
The way these BNF grammars evaluate strings can be represented as a tree, in a similar way to sentence
diagrams:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">    +
   / \
  1   +
     / \
    2   +
       / \
      3   +
         / \
        4   +
           / \
          5   6</code></pre>
<p>
In fact, the way we’ll be interpreting these expressions will necessitate building a tree,
which we can evaluate from the bottom up. Numbers will evaluate to their own value, and <code>+</code>
will evaluate as the sum of its left and right children. The tree above could be interpreted by
going all the way to the bottom, having <code>5</code> and <code>6</code> evaluate to themselves,
and then stepping up, the <code>+</code> would be interpreted as <code>5+6</code> and result in the
new tree
</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">    +
    / \
   1   +
      / \
     2   +
        / \
       3   +
          / \
         4   11</code></pre>
<p>
and from there the process would repeat until the top node was evaluated. If we define a <code>Node</code> class
to act as a node of a binary tree, we can create a function to build this interpretation tree:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Node:
    def __init__(self, label=None, parent=None, left=None, right=None):
        self.label  = label
        self.left   = left
        self.right  = right</code></pre>
<p>
Using the <code>Token</code> class defined earlier now, we modify our <code>expression</code>> function to take
an array of <code>Token</code>s and return them in a stack in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). This is helpful
because RPN is more explicit about operator precedence than infix notation, and because it is easier to build
the tree from this stack than it is to build it in place.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def expression(tokens, stack=None):
    if stack is None:
        stack = []
    if len(tokens) == 0:
        return
    current_token = tokens[0]
    if current_token.token == 'NUM':
        stack.append(current_token)
        expression(tokens[1:], stack)
    elif current_token.token == '+':
        expression(tokens[1:], stack)
        stack.append(current_token)
    return stack</code></pre>
<p>
Now, reading the tokens rearranged into RPN, each number is placed into an internal stack, and each <code>+</code>
pops two values from the stack and pushes a node back onto the stack, building up the abstract syntax tree.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def build_ast(tokens):
    stack = []
    for t in tokens:
        if t.token == 'NUM' or t.token == 'VAR':
            stack.append(t)
        else:
            if len(stack) &lt; 2:
                raise RuntimeError('Stack underflow.')
            new_node = Node(label=t)
            right = stack.pop()
            left = stack.pop()
            if isinstance(left, Node):
                new_node.left = left
            else:
                new_node.left = Node(label=left)
            if isinstance(right, Node):
                new_node.right = right
            else:
                new_node.right = Node(label=right)
            stack.append(new_node)
    if len(stack) == 1:
        return stack.pop()
    else:
        raise RuntimeError('Tree unbuilt on stack.')</code></pre>
<p>
The last thing to do is evaluate the abstract syntax tree. We can do this by walking the tree, and if the value of the tree at a node is a number, returning the number, otherwise if it is a sum, returning the sum of the left and right nodes recursively.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def eval_tree(tree):
    token = tree.label.token
        if token == 'NUM':
            return tree.label.value
        elif token == '+':
            return eval_tree(tree.left) + eval_tree(tree.right)</code></pre>


<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; t = build_ast(expression([Token('NUM', 1), Token('+'), Token('NUM', 2), Token('+'), Token('NUM', 3)]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_tree(t)
(+, None)
  (NUM, 1)
  (+, None)
    (NUM, 2)
    (NUM, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval_tree(t)

And thus we have an extremely basic calculator. From this foundation though, adding subtraction, multiplication, and division are simple enough, and just involve making our grammar a little more complex and then adding the operations in our <code>eval_tree</code> function, but that and the rest of the write-up of this project will have to come in a part 2.
